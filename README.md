#Here is a summary of the notebook code:

Imported Libraries: Loads essential libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).

Loaded Data: Reads the breast cancer dataset from a CSV file(breast cancer csv).

Initial Data Exploration: Displays the first and last few rows, summary statistics, info, shape, and checks for missing values.

Preprocessing:

Converts the diagnosis column to binary (M=1 for malignant, B=0 for benign).
Drops non-feature columns like id.
(If present) Drops the column Unnamed: 32 (based on previous context).
Feature/Target Split: Separates features (X) and target (y).

Train/Test Split & Scaling: Splits the data into training and test sets, then standardizes the features.

Model Training: Fits a logistic regression model on the training data.

Evaluation:

Predicted probabilities and class labels on the test set.
Calculated confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
Ploted the ROC curve.
Threshold Tuning: Finds the best threshold using Youdenâ€™s J statistic to optimize classification.

sigmoid function : The sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, is a mathematical function that produces a characteristic "S" shaped curve. In machine learning, it's primarily used as an activation function within neural networks and as a key component of logistic regression,The sigmoid function maps any real number input into a value between 0 and 1. This "squashing" property makes it useful for tasks where the output needs to be interpreted as a probability, which is always between 0 and 1.


Save Results: Saves the test set predictions and probabilities to a new CSV file(cleaned csv).
